# Streams (H1)

-Streams are an abstraction/tool provided by Node.js to handle data efficiently in chunks.

They are implemented using objects, classes, and events, and used for operations like:

Reading files

Writing files

Sending/receiving data over HTTP

Working with network sockets

You can think of them as a powerful tool in Node.js for memory-efficient and real-time data processing

# Sockets (H1)

- A socket in Node.js refers to a two-way communication channel â€” allowing real-time, bi-directional communication between a client and a server.

It's mainly used for:

Chat applications

Online multiplayer games

Live notifications

Collaborative apps (like Google Docs)

# Buffer (H1)

- Buffer = temporary storage for raw binary data

- In Node.js, a Buffer is a built-in object used to handle binary data (like files, images, audio/video, streams) directly in memory.
